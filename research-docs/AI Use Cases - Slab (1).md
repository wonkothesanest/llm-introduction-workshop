## Management [Dusty Hagstrom](https://omnidian.slab.com/users/bum2emq2) [Quigley Freedman](https://omnidian.slab.com/users/quc8yo4f) 

Ideas: Dusty uses AI quite a bit to help him do his management role. Working through some use cases there and sharing with Quigley could be helpful for other ENG managers. Feel free to include Gemini in these use cases.

- Staying informed. Emails, google docs, slack channels. How do I keep up with this firehose of information coming from everywhere all the time?
